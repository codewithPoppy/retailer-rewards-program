# Rewards Program

This project demonstrates a rewards program for a retail scenario, where customers earn points for each transaction based on the amount spent. The system calculates reward points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100.

## Features

- **React JS Implementation:** Utilizes React JS for building the user interface without TypeScript.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Simulates fetching transaction data asynchronously to mimic real-life API calls.
- **Dynamic Reward Calculation:** Calculates rewards based on customer transactions dynamically, demonstrating logic handling within the React application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
